    <h1>How to Use the Matrix</h1>

    <h2>Overview of the Matrix</h2>
    <p>
        The Real Estate Development Matrix combines the seven stages of the real estate development process with the
        eight tasks that must be completed during each
        stage. This 56-cell matrix captures the real estate development activities in a comprehensive and holistic
        manner. This broad view of the real estate
        development process considers the entire lifespan of a property over seven stages:
    </p>

    <ol>
        <li>Land Banking Stage</li>
        <li>Land Packaging Stage</li>
        <li>Land Development Stage</li>
        <li>Building Development Stage</li>
        <li>Building Operations Stage</li>
        <li>Building Renovation Stage</li>
        <li>Property Redevelopment Stage</li>
    </ol>

    <p>
        This process may take several decades to complete, and then the cycle starts again as the redevelopment property
        goes back to the land packaging stage and
        process begins anew. The development tasks are also considered in a very broad sense as they are grouped into
        eight categories:
    </p>

    <ol type="I">
        <li>Acquisition</li>
        <li>Financing</li>
        <li>Marketing Studies/ Strategies</li>
        <li>Environmental</li>
        <li>Approvals/ Permits</li>
        <li>Improvements</li>
        <li>Transportation/Accessibility</li>
        <li>Sales/Disposition</li>
    </ol>

    <p>
        When the seven stages of real estate development are placed on a horizontal axis, and the eight categories of
        tasks of development are placed on the
        vertical axis, we create the <strong>Real Estate Development Matrix</strong> (Exhibit M.1) which lays out the
        "work space" for the real estate development
        activities into 56 cells.
    </p>
    <img src="../img/how-to-1.png" class="img-fluid" alt="how to 1">

    <p>
        As Exhibit M.2 illustrates, the individual cells in the Development Matrix can be identified using Arabic
        Numbers for the Development Stages across the
        rows and Roman Numerals for the Development Tasks down the columns as identifiers. For example, Cell I.1. would
        be the <strong>Acquisition Tasks</strong>
        in the <strong>Land Banking Stage</strong>. Cell III. 4. would be the <strong>Marketing Tasks</strong> in the
        <strong>Building Development Stage</strong>,
        and so on.
    </p>
    <img src="../img/how-to-2.png" class="img-fluid" alt="how to 2">

    <p>
        Not all cells have the same importance in every stage, but all of the cells must be addressed in one way or the
        other. Ignoring or over-looking cells can
        lead to mistakes, errors, and ultimately an unsuccessful real estate development project.
    </p>

    <p>
        Developers create value in each stage of development by completing the tasks for that stage. Each stage requires
        different skills to complete the task, and
        no one person can do everything. Hence, different development teams are formed for each stage of development.
    </p>

    <p>
        It is important to note that in each cell three things happen:
    </p>

    <ol>
        <li>Expenditures are made.</li>
        <li>Risks are taken.</li>
        <li>Value is created or destroyed.</li>
    </ol>
    <img src="../img/how-to-3.png" class="img-fluid" alt="how to 3">

    <p>
        The Developers work down the columns of the <strong>Matrix</strong>. They can't go to the next <strong>Stage of
        Development </strong>until all the <strong>Development Tasks</strong> of the current stage are completed. Each
        <strong>Stage</strong> begins with the <strong>Acquisition Tasks</strong> and
        ends with the <strong>Disposition Tasks.</strong> (See Exhibit M.3) In between, <strong>Tasks</strong> are done
        in various orders, usually simultaneously,
        as the <strong>Tasks </strong>are all related to each other. For example, you can't get a building permit until
        the environmental studies have done and the
        plans and specifications have been completed. Real estate development is a great example of "multi-tasking."
    </p>

    <p>
        The <strong>Disposition Tasks</strong> may lead the developer to the decision "not to sell" and instead continue
        on to the next <strong>Stage of Development</strong>. Through the <strong>Disposition Tasks,</strong> the
        developer is well aware of the value that he has created, as
        well as the tasks that are required for the next stage of development. Even if the developer decides to continue
        to the next <strong>Stage of Development</strong> and put the created economic value at risk, he must assemble a
        new team of professionals to accomplish the <strong>Task</strong> for the next <strong>Stage </strong>and
        hopefully create additional value. Sometimes this works; sometimes it doesn't.
    </p>

    <p>
        Many times real estate service providers (professionals) ask, "Where do we belong in the Development Matrix? The
        answer is everywhere! Professionals
        generally specialize in one <strong>Task</strong> category and work across the various <strong>Stages</strong>
        of the <strong>Process</strong> (see Exhibit
        M.4).
    </p>
    <img src="../img/how-to-4.png" class="img-fluid" alt="how to 4">

    <p>
        However, it should be noted that different types of professionals are used in the various stages of development.
        For example, the best land broker used in
        the <strong>Land Banking Stage</strong> would not be used in the <strong>Building Development Stage,</strong>
        where the best leasing agents and building
        brokers would be used by the developer. Also the building contractor in <strong>the Building Development
        Stage </strong>would probably not have the
        necessary skills for the construction required in the <strong>Building Renovation Stage</strong>.
