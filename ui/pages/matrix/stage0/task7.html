<h1>Transportation and Accessibility</h1><br><p>The <strong>Transportation and A</strong><strong>ccessibility
    Tasks</strong> require the developer to determine not only what transportation systems (public and private) the
    space users (tenants, customers, suppliers) will use to get to the property, but also to determine how tenants,
    customers, and suppliers will get around the site once they have reached it. In some cases these off-site
    transportation systems and in all cases the on-site accessibility systems must be designed, engineered, and
    constructed.</p> <p><strong>Off-Site: Transportation</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Evaluate the existing transportation systems available to bring people and goods to the
        property&nbsp;.</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Determine what changes or improvements to those systems are required to improve bringing goods and
        people to the site..</strong></li>
    <li><strong>&nbsp;Evaluate if these changes or improvements can be permitted, designed and constructed in a timely
        and cost effective manner.</strong></li>
</ul> <p></p> <p><strong>On-Site: Accessibility</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>Determine how will goods and services and people will access their destination once they arrive on site.</li>
    <li>Determine if roads, trails, walkways, elevators, escalators, and storage areas are adequate to handle the
        expected traffic among buildings and within buildings.
    </li>
    <li>Determine if these accessibility improvements can be designed and constructed in a timely and cost-effective
        manner.
    </li>
    <li>Determine the priorities of what must be accessible:</li>
    <ul>
        <li>Parking</li>
        <li>Building entrances</li>
        <li>Waste removal</li>
        <li>Mail and freight</li>
        <li>Suite entrances</li>
        <li>Emergency accessways and life-safety facilities and systems</li>
    </ul>
</ul> <p><strong>On &amp; Off – Site: Construction</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>Determine required public approval and permits.</li>
    <li>Evaluate if Transportation &amp; Accessibility improvements can be built on-time and on budget:</li>
    <ul>
        <li>general and sub-contractors</li>
        <li>limited capacity/availability during the building season</li>
    </ul>
    <li>Determine if the necessary building materials are available and affordable.</li>
    <li>Evaluate the availability of public funding sources to finance roads, terminals, walkways, etc.</li>
    <li>Evaluate the effect of state, regional, or municipal tax subsidies for funding transportation and accessibility
        improvements.
    </li>
</ul> <p></p> <p><strong>On &amp; Off – Site:</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>Determine how the constructed transportation and accessibility improvement will be maintained and operated in
        good working order over their life cycle.
    </li>
    <li>Identify the appropriate vendors available to maintain and operated the transportation and accessibility
        improvements.
    </li>
    <li>Establish appropriate reserves for future repairs and/or replacement.</li>
    <li>Clearly define and assign maintenance responsibilities.</li>
    <li>Define and distribute emergency plans.</li>
</ul>
