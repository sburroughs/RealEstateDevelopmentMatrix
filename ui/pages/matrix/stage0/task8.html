<h1>Sales and Disposition</h1><br><p>The <strong>Sales and D</strong><strong>isposition Tasks</strong> require the
    developer to complete the seller’s due diligence, to market the property for sale, to negotiate and execute a sales
    contract and finally to negotiate any necessary development agreements. The developer may decide not to sell the
    property at this stage and continue on to the next stage of development. In this case, the disposition exercise is
    then blended in to the acquisition stage for the subsequent stage of development.</p> <p><strong>Seller’s Due
