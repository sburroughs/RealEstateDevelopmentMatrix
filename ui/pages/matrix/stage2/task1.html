<h1>I.2 Land Packaging Acquisition </h1><br>
<p>Acquisitions – Land Packaging (I.2.)</p>
<p>Identify a property&nbsp;that meets (at least) one of the&nbsp;three opportunity categories.&nbsp;No problems;
    only opportunities. The land packager must be able to find properties that have a development issue or problems
    and fix that issue in a timely manner. This is why many land packagers have formal training in law ,
    engineering, or land planning or have substantial experience in politics and government.</p>
<ol>
    <li>Ready for development but improperly zoned.</li>
</ol>
<p>This is most common&nbsp;situation for the land packager. The land packager develops a conceptual land plan and
    set about getting that land plan approved by the appropriate governing bodies. These are usually zoning or
    planning commissions as well as city councils or county/township supervisory boards. The land packager must
    determine not only what approvals are needed , but also how to obtain those approvals in a timely manner.</p>
<p> 2.Contains development impairments that can be remedied by studies, tests, and /or expert opinions.</p>
<p>The land packager&nbsp;must correctly identify the development issues and then determine what experts can provide
    the information to clarify the problems or identify the best cost effective solutions to the problems. These
    problems may include wetland issues, contamination issues, soil and rock conditions, neighborhood concerns or
    protests, historical or cultural issues, or adjacent land issues such as railroads, airports, prisons, or coffee
    manufacturer.</p>
<p> 3.Has existing title or survey issue.</p>
<p>Most&nbsp;buyers avoid these kinds of problems, but with experience and special skills land packagers enjoy
    working out boundary issues, easement or right or way issues, existing liens, and clouds on the title. The
    timeliness and cost of fixing these issues is are the key factors for the land packager to assess. Almost any
    “problem” can be fixed with enough time and enough money., but the land packager cannot afford either.</p>
<p>Evaluate if the regulatory environment&nbsp;is receptive to changing land use conditions.</p>
<p>Clearly some&nbsp;municipalities and jurisdictions are easier to work in than others. However, know how the
    system or process works and who works the system is critical knowledge for the land packager. Perceived
    “outsiders” will bet treated much differently than known, credible, local people. The successful land packager
    will either need to be a “good ol’ boy or gal” or will be able to bring those people on her team.</p>
<p>On the other hand, municipalities or jurisdictions that have a difficult reputation, are creating opportunities
    for land packagers because of the perceived “barriers to entry” that limit the number of competitive
    development. Land packager must critically evaluate their ability to work in the system and moor importantly to
    achieve permits and approvals in a timely manner.</p>
<p><strong>Acquire or control the property with attractive prices and conditions.&nbsp;</strong> The important&nbsp;part
    is to control the property rather than to own the property outright. Creative financing often includes some of
    the following:</p>
<p>Seller financing; The seller lends the buyer the money to property. This also referred to as a&nbsp;purchase
    money mortgage.</p>
<p>Option agreements:&nbsp;buyer&nbsp;acquires the right to purchase the property at a specified sometime some time
    in the future. Extension provisions can very important</p>
<p>Sales contract with conditions, pre-conditions to close: A sales contract can be used to control the property
    until&nbsp;certain condition are met prior to closing. Sales contract usually have non-refundable good faith
    deposits, and there are usually extension provisions in the contract.</p>
<p>Lease with option to buy: land leases allow the lessee (prospective buyer) to control the property (subject to
    the lease provisions), and the lease has provisions allowing the lessor to purchase the property at certain
    times during the lease term. The price of the property should be specified, but often it is not so the purchase
    price is at the market value or at a price mutually agreed upon between the lessor and the lessee</p>
<p><strong>Land contracts: </strong>The land contract provides for the title to pass from the seller to the buyer
    after certain specific terms and conditions are met.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Interim land uses: These can provide rental income to the land banker which help to defray the holding costs.
    These uses can be as simple as seasonal hunting lease or as complex as a long term commercial lease with
    termination provisions.</p>
<p>Are there&nbsp;interim land uses&nbsp;to be dealt with? (Positive or Negative?)</p>
<p>Interim land uses are a two-edged sword. They can be very helpful in reducing the holding&nbsp;costs, and they
    can be very problematic in changing the use of the site or getting adjacent land owners to be cooperative.</p>
