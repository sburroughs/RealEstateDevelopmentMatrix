<h1>VII.1 Land Banking Transportation and Accessibility</h1><br>
<p>Transportation &amp; Accessibility – Land Banking (VII.1.)</p>
<p><strong>Focus on&nbsp;future changes&nbsp;to“big picture” transportation systems:</strong></p>
<p> •Highways</p>
<p> •Railways: heavy and light rail</p>
<p> •Airports, seaports, and commercial railroad terminals</p>
<p> •Regional trails and pathways</p>
<p><strong>Focus on “property specific” accessibility issues:</strong></p>
<p> •Ingress – getting into the property</p>
<p> •Egress – getting out of the property</p>
<p> •Getting around within the property</p>
<p> •Physical features</p>
<p> •Legal restrictions</p>
<p><strong>Estimate the timeline for future transportation and accessibility improvements:</strong></p>
<p> •Current activity</p>
<p> •1-3 years;&nbsp;4-7 years; 8-10 years</p>
<p> •Estimate the probability of completion</p>
<p><strong>Contact the appropriate governmental personnel and political figures about transportation and
    accessibility improvements:</strong></p>
<p> •Without their help and support, nothing will happen.</p>
<p> •Emphasize&nbsp;the benefits to the region.</p>
<p> •Evaluate their level of support.</p>
<p><strong>Determine if additional land parcels are required:</strong></p>
<p> •Possible land assemblage opportunity</p>
<p> •Evaluate probability&nbsp;of current owners cooperating</p>
<p><strong>Will the property be subject to Eminent Domain actions or restrictive easements or
    right-of-ways?</strong></p>
<p> •Eminent&nbsp;domain: government taking property at market value for a public use.</p>
<p> •Restrictive&nbsp;easements: regulations limit the use of the site.</p>
<p> •Avigation (or aviation) easements limiting the height of the buildings near airports.</p>
<p> •Noise regulation limiting the type of development around airport.</p>
<p> •Compensation is not always provided to impacted property owners.</p>
<p> •Right-of ways:&nbsp;governmental or quasi-government right to use (part of) the property but not to occupy
    it.</p>
<p> •Market value compensation to property owner. </p>
<p> •These takings can be an opportunity because it establishes the land banker as a stake holder in the
    transportation improvements.</p>
