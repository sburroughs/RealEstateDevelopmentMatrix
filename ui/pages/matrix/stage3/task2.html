<h1>II.3 Land Development Financing </h1><br><p>Financing – Land Development (II.3.)</p> <p>Land acquisitions require
    equity (and some debt).</p>
<ul>
    <li>The land for development is usually funded by equity capital.</li>
    <li>Sometimes debt capital is used to acquire the property</li>
</ul> <p>Construction requires accruing debt for hard costs, equity contributions for soft costs.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Some or all direct construction costs (aka hard costs) can be funded with an interest accruing construction loan
        from a commercial bank.
    </li>
    <li>Indirect construction costs aka soft costs) are usually funded with equity capital.</li>
</ul> <p>Land sales require a “release price” to remove the building ready land parcels from the construction
    mortgage.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Finished building lots that are being sold to a building developers must be “released” from the construction
        mortgage lien.
    </li>
    <li>This release requires a payment to the construction lender that exceeds the pro-rata share of the finished
        building lot’s value in the entire encumbered property.
    </li>
    <li>The construction lender’s intent is have the loan paid off before all of the lots are sold.</li>
    <li>This effectively delays the land developer’s cash proceeds until the last lots are sold.</li>
</ul> <p>Performance or completion bonds are required.</p>
<ul>
    <li>These bonds assure the bond holder (the lender) that the bonding company will funds provided need to complete
        the development in the event the contractor defaults during construction.
    </li>
</ul> <p>Fiduciary bonds.</p>
<ul>
    <li>These bond provide a financial guaranty to the municipality in the event that the improvements fail after
        construction .
    </li>
</ul> <p>This is a “beat the clock” game. Can the building lots be sold before the construction mortgage comes due?</p>
<ul>
    <li>The land developer must be ready to start construction as soon as the land is acquired so that the improvements
        can be constructed and the building lots are sold prior to the end of the construction loan term.
    </li>
    <li>&nbsp;Otherwise, the construction loans must be extended or paid off.&nbsp;</li>
</ul> <p>Determine the financing of subsequent phases.</p>
<ul>
    <li>A large land development usually is built in phases.</li>
    <li>Consequently, the land developer must determine a way to ‘bank” the subsequent phases while the current phase is
        under construction.
    </li>
    <ul>
        <li>Delayed closing provision in the original sale s agreement.</li>
        <li>&nbsp;Option to purchase the future phases when they are ready for development.</li>
        <li>Equity investors.</li>
        <li>Land contracts.</li>
    </ul>
</ul> <p>A good example of the&nbsp;financing of a land development for a warehouse industrial office part would be: <a
