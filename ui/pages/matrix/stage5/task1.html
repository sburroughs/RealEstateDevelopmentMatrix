<h1>I.5 Building Operations Acquisition </h1><br>
<p>Acquisitions – Building Operations (I.5.)</p>
<ul>
    <li>The Building Operator initially acquires the property from the Building Developer. However, after this
        initial acquisition the Building Developer may sell the building to another operator, and this may occur
        several time over the economic life of the property.&nbsp;</li>
    <li>Similarly, the Building Operator may acquire the property from the Building Renovator who has updated the
        property physically and re-marketed the property accordingly.
    </li>
    <li>The Building Operator needs a clear understanding of her investment objectives and strategy, so the
        acquisition of the property can be evaluated in the context of the overall investment portfolio strategy.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>Determine if the constructed building can be acquired at an attractive price and terms (holdbacks).</p>
<ul>
    <li>The acquisition of a newly constructed building from a Building Operator usually requires some or all of the
        following&nbsp;hold backs for unleased or unoccupied space:
    </li>
    <ul>
        <li>Tenant improvements</li>
        <li>Leasing commissions</li>
        <li>&nbsp;Economic earn outs.</li>
    </ul>
    <li>The vendor agreements and contracts should be transferable or cancellable as the case may be.</li>
    <li>All equipment warranties and guarantees should be transferred.</li>
    <li>The Building Developer and Renovator are not usually good candidates for seller financing because they need
        to pay of their own construction loans.
    </li>
    <li>If the seller is another building operator, there my be opportunities for a creative financing in the form
        of seller financing (purchase-money mortgages)&nbsp;or existing and assumable financing.
    </li>
    <li>Wrap-around mortgages&nbsp;are used when an existing&nbsp;mortgage is kept in place, and the seller makes a
        purchase-money mortgage that is equal to the existing mortgage plus and additional amount. The seller, who
        is now the wrap around lender, makes the payments on the existing mortgage while the buyer, now the
        wraparound borrow, maonly one payment to the wraparound lender.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>Determine if the property can be leased at expected rent levels (price &amp; occupancy) during the lease-up
    period.</p>
<ul>
    <li>The Building Operator must estimate the probability of achieving&nbsp;both the rental rates and the
        occupancy level during the lease-up period. This may include the provision of inducements such as free-rent,
        additional tenant improvements, or moving costs reimbursements.
    </li>
    <li>The Building Developer must also assess the risk of re-leasing the property when existing tenants move
        out.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>Estimate if current market conditions will remain steady or improve during the expected lease-up and holding
    period.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Of course the market conditions will change during the Building Operators expected holding period, but the
        question is whether the changes will increase or decrease the property’s value.&nbsp;</li>
    <li>Regional economic forecasts must be considered and evaluated.</li>
    <li>New and existing competitive properties must be identified and evaluated.</li>
</ul>
<p>Determine if the building operations and technologies are efficient. (Identify areas of improvement).</p>
<ul>
    <li>Building commissioning is a requirement for newly constructed buildings that are seeking a LEED
        certification.
    </li>
    <li>Building commissioning confirms that all of the building operational systems are correctly installed and
        operating appropriately.
    </li>
    <li>Every meter and monitoring device is checked for accuracy. This commissioning activity is all done prior to
        occupancy. This is a major improvement over the good old days when new building systems were testing and
        balance during the early stages of operation and occupancy.
    </li>
    <li>Building operators who are acquiring existing building from other building operators must verify the
        operational efficiency as seeks out area that can be improved.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>Determine if the expected tenants will flourish in the new building.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Building operators must determine if the current tenants or the prospective tenants&nbsp;will be successful
        businesses in the building.
    </li>
    <li>To some extent, the Building Operators must underwrite the business plans of the tenants and determine if
        they are right for the building.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>Determine if the expected financing terms can be improved over time.</p>
<ul>
    <li>The Building&nbsp;Operator&nbsp;must&nbsp;underwrite the acquisition in terms of the best capital structure
        for the property that include both debt and equity capital.
    </li>
    <li>The Building Operator must be forward looking to determine how the capital structure can be improved in the
        future.
    </li>
    <ul>
        <li>Lower interest rate</li>
        <li>Long amortization periods</li>
        <li>Longer term loans</li>
        <li>Consolidate loans</li>
        <li>Lower Debt Coverage Ratios</li>
        <li>Higher Loan to Value Ratios</li>
        <li>New equity investors with lower return expectations</li>
    </ul>
</ul>
