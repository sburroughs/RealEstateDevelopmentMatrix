<h1>IV.5 Building Operations Environmental</h1><br><p>Environmental – Building Operations (IV.5.)</p> <p><strong>Continued
    maintenance and monitoring of building systems is critical.</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>Energy monitoring&nbsp;systems are a great way to check on building efficiency and find energy cost savings.
    </li>
</ul> <p><strong>Keep accurate records of maintenance and use.</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>This will&nbsp;help as reference guides when repairs or renovations are needed.</li>
    <li>It is also critical to have these records on hand when submitting for certifications.</li>
</ul> <p><strong>Require tenant improvements to meet green initiatives.</strong></p> <p><strong>Encourage tenants and
    building users to participate and support green initiatives (recycling and decreased energy use requires tenant
    participation).</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>Sustainability&nbsp;initiatives must be embraced by the building users.</li>
    <li>Tenant education on how to make sure the systems in place are used and used correctly.</li>
    <li>The participation of the “People” impacts the “Planet” by lowering waste, water, and energy usage, and impacts
        the “Profit” by keeping operating costs low.
    </li>
</ul> <p><strong>Research new sustainable technologies to improve life cycle of the building:</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>energy monitoring systems,</li>
    <li>LED lights,</li>
    <li>low flow plumbing&nbsp;fixtures.</li>
</ul> <p><strong>Continued education and training of new systems and best practices.</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>Environmental and sustainability is&nbsp;newer concept of real estate development, with a lot of change and
        improvement in the industry each day.
    </li>
    <ul>
        <li>Staying current with trends and new technologies, and</li>
        <li>then incorporating applicable systems into building operations will help to maximize efficiency in building
            systems.
