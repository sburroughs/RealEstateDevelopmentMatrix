<h1>I.4 Building Development Acquisition </h1><br><p>Acquisitions – Building Development (I.4.)</p> <p>The acquisition
    tasks for Building Development are very similar to the acquisition tasks for the Land Developer except that the
    Building Developer must be focused on estimating the probabilities of leasing the building while it is under
    construction as well as selling the property to a Building Operator.</p> <p>Determine if the building-ready pad can
    be acquired at a price that, when improved with the building, yields a required rate of return on total cost
    (Rtc).</p> <p>The Building Developer usually buys the finished lot with equity capital and intends to start
    construction the day of closing! Consequently,&nbsp;creative financing is not that important. However, the Building
    may negotiate certain terms in the purchase agreement that will prevent the Land Developer from impairing the
    competitiveness and profitability of the project. For example, the following provisions may be appropriate:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Restrict the Land Developer’s ability to sell lots&nbsp;to competitive projects for a certain period of time,
        say three years, or until the newly constructed building reaches a certain occupancy level.
    </li>
    <li>Provide a “first right of offer” to the Building Developer&nbsp;when additional lots are offered for sale.</li>
    <li>Estimate&nbsp;the Building Operators purchase price (based on overall capitalization rates) as well possible
        holdback that may be a condition of the sale. The Building Developer needs to pay off the construction loan at
        the time of sale so the hold backs cannot be too restrictive.
    </li>
</ul> <p>Determine if the building can be competitively bid by contractors and sub-contractor.</p>
<ul>
    <li>&nbsp;Building&nbsp;developers usually have preferred general contractor and major sub-contractors. The
        availability of these firms is a critical determinant of when or if the Building&nbsp;Developer decides to
        acquire the building pad.
    </li>
    <li>Current pricing of the construction project is imperative because the Building Developer may be using old or
        inaccurate building costs estimates.
    </li>
</ul> <p>Determine if the property be pre-leased or leased up during construction.</p>
<ul>
    <li>The best way for a Building Developer to create value is by pre-leasing&nbsp;the Building&nbsp;or leasing it up
        during construction.
    </li>
    <li>The Building&nbsp;Developer needs to understand the leasing market and develop a strategy to secure competitive
        leases
    </li>
</ul> <p>Estimate if the current market conditions improve or remain steady during construction and lease-up</p>
<ul>
    <li>If&nbsp;the current market conditions are good, how long will they last?</li>
    <li>If the current market conditions are bad, when will they change? We always recognize market bubbles after they
        occur, when it is too late to act.
    </li>
    <li>The Building&nbsp;Development period needs to include&nbsp;the pre-construction&nbsp;time, the building
        construction time, and the expected lease-up period.
    </li>
</ul> <p>Determine the expected “spread” sufficient to justify the risk.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Does&nbsp;the expected return justify the risks involved in the Building&nbsp;Development?</li>
    <li>The value created must be greater than the cost of the project so that the profit or spread is reward for the
        risk-taking.
    </li>
</ul> <p>Estimate the capital requirements of the Building Development.</p>
<ul>
    <li>The&nbsp;building&nbsp;developer need determine:&nbsp;</li>
    <ul>
        <li>how much capital is needed (uses of funds)</li>
        <li>who can provide the capital (sources of funds)</li>
        <li>how long the capital is needed (investment duration)</li>
    </ul>
    <li>Equity investors are needed to acquire the finished building lot and to fund cash flow deficits during the
        construction and lease-up period. These are usually the soft costs.
    </li>
    <ul>
        <li>Construction loans are needed to fund as much of the direct construction costs (the hard costs) as
            possible
        </li>
        <li>Construction loan extensions, often called mini-perms,” are useful to manage the lease-up risks.</li>
    </ul>
