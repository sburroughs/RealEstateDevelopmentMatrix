<h1>II.7 Property Redevelopment Financing </h1><br><p>Financing – Property Redevelopment (II.7.)</p> <p>Property
    redevelopment (like land banking) requires mostly equity capital.</p>
<ul>
    <li>This is a waiting game, requiring patient capital.</li>
    <ul>
        <li>Redevelopers look for capital that is “patient,” that is it does not require immediate returns and is
            willing to wait for the eventual sale of the property when the market conditions are favorable.
        </li>
        <li>Patient money is not “dumb money” and the expected returns must justify the risks involved.</li>
        <li>Patient money is hard to find.</li>
    </ul>
    <li>Interim land uses are necessary, however, unreliable and inadequate as a long term financing solution.</li>
    <ul>
        <li>Unreliable and inadequate annual income do not support debt payments.</li>
        <li>Regular debt payments require regular rental income of regular equity contributions.</li>
        <li>Without predictable income form interim land uses, debt should be avoided.</li>
        <li>Very low loan-to-value ratio (0 is best.)</li>
    </ul>
</ul> <p>Seller financing can be critical.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Seller financing.</li>
    <ul>
        <li>The&nbsp;buyer developer should look to the seller as a source funds to acquire the property.</li>
        <li>The selling&nbsp;developer should consider financing some of the sales price to the buying developer.</li>
        <li>&nbsp;There&nbsp;are costs and benefits in all of the various kinds of Seller-financing schemes:</li>
    </ul>
</ul> <p>Seller financing; The seller lends the buyer the money to property. This also referred to as a purchase money
    mortgage*.</p> <p>Option agreements:&nbsp;Buyer&nbsp;acquires the right to purchase the property at a specified
    sometime some time in the future. Extension provisions can very important.</p> <p>Sales contract with conditions,
    pre-conditions to close: A sales contract can be used to control the property until&nbsp;certain condition are met
    prior to closing. Sales contracts usually have non-refundable good faith deposits, and there are usually extension
    provisions in the contract.</p> <p>Lease with option to buy: Land leases allow the lessee (prospective buyer) to
    control the property (subject to the lease provisions), and the lease has provisions allowing the lessor to purchase
    the property at certain times during the lease term. The price of the property should be specified, but often it is
    not so the purchase price is at the market value or at a price mutually agreed upon between the lessor and the
    lessee.</p> <p>Land contracts: The land contract provides for the title to pass from the seller to the buyer after
    certain specific terms and conditions are met.&nbsp;</p> <p>Interim land uses: These can provide rental income to
    the land banker which help to defray the holding costs. These uses can be as simple as seasonal hunting lease or as
    complex as a long-term commercial lease with termination provisions.</p> <p>If government redevelopment agencies
    “own” the property, gaining control of the property without a capital down payment can be easier.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Government agencies seem more willing to give the redeveloper control of the property if the property developer
        indicates interest in improving the property.
    </li>
    <li>A first right of offer may be sufficient for the redeveloper; however, an option to purchase at a fixed price
        would be better.
    </li>
</ul> <p>It is best to let the government agencies “own” the property until it is ready for land or building
    development.</p>
<ul>
    <li>The redeveloper should negotiate enough time to have the property re-zoned so that an actual purchase does not
        occur until the property is ready for land development or building development
    </li>
</ul> <p>Consider assemblage opportunities.</p>
<ul>
    <li>The redeveloper should evaluate the acquisition of additional (preferably adjacent) that would enhance the
        development potential of the combined sites.
    </li>
