<h1>III.6 Building Renovation Market Analysis and Strategies</h1><br><p>Acquisitions - Land Development
    (I.3.)</p> <p> Determine if a properly zoned and permitted property can be acquired and sold as subdivided,
    building-ready lots when the horizontal infrastructure is constructed. </p>
<ul>
    <li>Land&nbsp;developer must use his:&nbsp;</li>
    <ul>
        <li>legal team to estimate the appropriateness and firmness of the approval andpermits,</li>
        <li>marketing research and marketing team to estimate the salability and pricing of the finished
            lots.&nbsp;</li>
    </ul>
</ul> <p>Determine if the required infrastructure improvements are known, defined, and priced.</p>
<ul>
    <li>The land developer use his engineering and construction teams to estimate the “feasibility “ of constructing the
        required infrastructure on time and on budget.
    </li>
    <li>If the infrastructure is not well defined, then the developer should not close on the property until it is.&nbsp;</li>
</ul> <p>Determine if the market conditions will improve or remain steady during the construction and sellout
    period.</p>
<ul>
    <li>If the proposed land development&nbsp;is financially feasible under the current market conditions, the developer
        need to determine the probability of the current conditions deteriorating.
    </li>
    <li>On the other hand, if the purposed land development is not financially feasible under the current market
        conditions, the developer must determine how much the current conditions need to improve. The developer is
        asking “what has to change to make this deal work.”
    </li>
    <li>If current market conditions are expected to improve, the critical determination is “when” will the conditions
        improve enough to make the project feasible.
    </li>
</ul> <p>Determine if attractive pricing and terms be negotiated.</p> <p><strong>Seller financing:</strong> The seller
    lends the buyer the money to property. This also referred to as a purchase money mortgage. </p> <p><strong>Option
    agreements:</strong> buyer acquires the right to purchase the property at a specified sometime some time in the
    future. Extension provisions can very important </p> <p><strong>Sales contract with conditions, pre-conditions to
    close:</strong> A sales contract can be used to control the property until certain condition are met prior to
    closing. Sales contract usually have non-refundable good faith deposits, and there are usually extension provisions
    in the contract. </p> <p><strong>Lease with option to buy:</strong> land leases allow the lessee (prospective buyer)
    to control the property (subject to the lease provisions), and the lease has provisions allowing the lessor to
    purchase the property at certain times during the lease term. The price of the property should be specified, but
    often it is not so the purchase price is at the market value or at a price mutually agreed upon between the lessor
    and the lessee </p> <p><strong>Land contracts:</strong> The land contract provides for the title to pass from the
    seller to the buyer after certain specific terms and conditions are met.&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>Interim land
    uses:</strong> These can provide rental income to the land banker which help to defray the holding costs. These uses
    can be as simple as seasonal hunting lease or as complex as a long term commercial lease with termination
    provisions. </p> <p>Estimate the sell-out period for the building ready pads prior to construction, during
    construction or after construction.&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
    <li>The estimation of the&nbsp;land development period, from construction through final sell-out, is critical to
        determine the duration of the financing required for the development.&nbsp;</li>
    <li>A land development with several phases is very tricky since future phases should not become competition for the
        current phase.&nbsp;</li>
    <li>Multiple phase development usually&nbsp;last longer than the average business cycled (5-7 years). This means
        that the land must be prepared for variable market conditions and possibly devastating downside risks.
    </li>
</ul> <p>Determine if the profit or “spread” is attractive enough to take the land development risks.</p>
<ul>
    <li>The&nbsp;Land Developer must determine if the potential profits are worth the risks incurred. That is, is the
        “spread” between Development Costs and future sales prices attractive enough to undertake the
        projects.&nbsp;</li>
    <li>The Land Developer must determine if there is a “back door” or a way out of the project if the market
        deteriorates too much.&nbsp;</li>
</ul> <p>Determine the capital requirements.</p>
<ul>
    <li>The land developer need determine:&nbsp;</li>
    <li>how much capital is needed (uses of funds).</li>
    <li>who can provide the capital (sources of funds)&nbsp;</li>
    <li>how long the capital is needed (investment duration)&nbsp;</li>
    <li>Equity investors are needed to acquire the land fund cash flow deficits during the development period.</li>
    <li>Construction loans are needed to fund some or all of the infrastructure construction costs.</li>
    <li>Short term loans (working capital loans) are needed to cover the funding gaps between the equity and
        construction loans.
    </li>
