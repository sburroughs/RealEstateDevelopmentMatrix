<h1>Building Renovation</h1>
<br>The “Building Renovator” buys the property with substantial economic and/or physical depreciation and creates value by curing these deficiencies then re-positioning and operating the building until the property is ready for redevelopment.  The unique skills and risks for building renovators are usually found in companies that specialize in “historic renovation.”  Currently, many shopping center developers are looking for  old centers that need to be fixed-up and re-marketed to different retail tenants.
