<h1>VI.6 Building Renovation Physical Improvements</h1><br><p>Improvements – Building Renovations (VI.6.)</p> <p>Design,
    engineer, and construct major building renovations.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Design-Bid-Build vs Design-Build</li>
    <li>Unexpected conditions may be discovered:</li>
    <ul>
        <li>Rotten wood</li>
        <li>Mold conditions</li>
        <li>Asbestos insulation</li>
    </ul>
    <li>Construction management contract based on time and materials may be appropriate.</li>
    <li>Experienced renovation contractors are critical.</li>
</ul> <p>Design drawings and renderings are critical to help stakeholders embrace the proposed improvements.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Two dimensional drawings are not “reader friendly."</li>
    <li>Models, photographs, renderings, and videos can tell the story much better.</li>
    <li>Video technology is advancing so rapidly that virtual tours are now relatively inexpensive.</li>
</ul> <p>Engineering drawings and renovation contractors must integrate new systems into the existing systems and public
    infrastructure.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Existing building systems must be evaluated to determine if they should be saved or replaced new.</li>
    <li>Public infrastructure tie-in is more problematic:</li>
    <ul>
        <ul>
            <li>Existing storm water systems are hard to expand.</li>
            <li>Existing electric power systems are more adaptable.</li>
            <li>Communication systems are constantly changing.</li>
        </ul>
    </ul>
</ul> <p>Renovation contractors must build new improvements while preserving old improvements and features.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Façade preservation or restoration is a public event!</li>
    <li>Document all work, before and after.</li>
    <li>Reach agreement with historical societies and preservation board prior to beginning construction.</li>
    <li>Trees have feelings too!</li>
    <ul>
        <ul>
            <li>Historic trees must be preserved or at least have a plan for restoration.</li>
            <li>Historic landscaping is hard to define, but vigorously defended.</li>
        </ul>
    </ul>
