<h1>II.6 Building Renovation Financing </h1><br>
<p>Financing – Building Renovations (II.6.)</p>
<p>Acquisition requires purchase of both land and building so debt and equity is usually required on the front
    end.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Debt capital for acquisition will usually have a first lien priority.</li>
    <li>The acquisition loan will need to be subordinated to the construction loan.</li>
</ul>
<p>Renovation loan (or construction loan) is usually an accrual loan that is tied to actual renovation construction
    (hard costs).</p>
<ul>
    <li>This is similar to the building construction loan.</li>
</ul>
<p>Soft costs are usually covered by equity contribution.</p>
<ul>
    <li>This arrangement is similar to the building construction loan.</li>
</ul>
<p>Holdover tenants must be taken into consideration and dealt with throughout the renovation period.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Holdover tenants may require special accommodations during the renovation period, such as entrances,
        security, or parking arrangements.
    </li>
    <li>These additional costs need to funded either through the renovation loan or through equity reserves.</li>
</ul>
<p>Like building development and land development, this is another “beat the clock” game; timing is critical.</p>
<ul>
    <li>The building renovator needs to be ready to start renovation as soon as the property is acquired.</li>
    <li>If the renovation construction and re-leasing are not completed prior to the renovation loan term, the
        renovation loan will need to be extended or the property will be need to be refinanced.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
