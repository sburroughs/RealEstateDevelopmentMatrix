<h1>IV.6 Building Renovation Environmental</h1><br><p>Environmental â€“ Building Renovations (IV.6.)</p> <p><strong>In
    building renovations, it is important&nbsp;to remember that you are dealing with previous mistakes, errors, and
    obsolete materials and technologies.</strong></p> <p><strong>Asbestos, mold, and lead paint are some of the most
    common environmental issues during renovation.</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>It is important to have a plan in place for if these items are discovered and how to remediate them.</li>
    <ul>
        <li>These issues are major considerations for not just the end users after renovation, but really for the
            workers performing the improvements, especially since asbestos and mold can be airborne issues.
        </li>
        <li>There are professionals that specialize in remediation of toxic waste and materials to help create
            identification and remediation plans and to perform the remediation if needed.
        </li>
    </ul>
</ul> <p><strong>Ensure code compliance for all updated codes, once a renovation starts you are no longer grandfathered
    in.</strong></p> <p><strong>Enhance positive historical and cultural aspects of the renovation.</strong></p> <p>
    <strong>Proper recycling of disposed materials is critical.</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>Use off-site sorting of&nbsp;recycle materials if possible</li>
</ul> <p><strong>Certifications are a nice touch to demonstrate the significant value of the renovation.</strong></p>
