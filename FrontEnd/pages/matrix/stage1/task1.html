<p>Acquisitions – Land Banking (I.1.)</p>
<p><strong>Long term trends to increase value of the subject property:</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>Population growth usually caused by increased&nbsp;employment in the region</li>
    <li>Transportation improvements usually&nbsp;related to government sponsored project</li>
    <ul>
        <li>Interstate Highway or major local highway extensions or new exit</li>
        <li>&nbsp;Transit extensions and stations</li>
    </ul>
</ul>
<p>Bus (rubber tire)</p>
<p>Street car lines</p>
<p>Light rail</p>
<p>Heavy rail</p>
<p>Airport Expansions or new carriers</p>
<p>Port facility expansions</p>
<p>Intermodal developments</p>
<ul>
    <li>Technology changes : such as</li>
    <ul>
        <li>driverless vehicles,</li>
        <li>renewable energy generation and storage,</li>
        <li>food production and processing,</li>
        <li>water treatment and recycling</li>
        <li>Solid waste processing</li>
    </ul>
</ul>
<p><strong>Capital partners be patient until the market changes occur.</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>Business&nbsp;cycles are 5-7 years in duration, usually.</li>
    <li>Government approvals and funding are indeterminist time wise.</li>
    <li>Federal,&nbsp;state and local government polices toward growth or land uses change constantly.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Analyze additional parcels for acquisitions (assemblage).</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>Adjacent land parcels&nbsp;may become available.</li>
    <li>Determine the value of the combined parcels (plottage value) relative to the cost the combined cos.t</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Implement interim land use plan to minimize the carrying cost over time, if possible.</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>Interim&nbsp;land uses should lower the net holding costs of the property.</li>
    <li>Interim land uses should not lower the value of the property or upset the neighbors.</li>
    <li>Interim land uses should be relatively short term in nature.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Identify the critical conditions for the vision to occur:</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>Sustained regional&nbsp;economic growth</li>
    <li>Changed land use regulations</li>
    <li>Construction of transportation improvement</li>
    <li>Infrastructure capacity</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Identify the major events or conditions that will make the vision obvious to the general market.</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>Determine the vision for the property over the next 5 – 10 years:</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>A concept master plan&nbsp;will help the investors and the general public image what the property could be
        some day.
    </li>
    <li>Artists’ renderings are a great tool to demonstrate the vision.</li>
    <li>New employers&nbsp;in&nbsp;the region.</li>
    <li>New ad different elected political leaders.</li>
    <li>Changing tax policies.</li>
    <li>International trade opportunities.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Determine how the property be acquired and held for the expected holding period or longer if
    necessary.</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>Seller financing; The seller lends the buyer the money to property. This also referred to as a purchase
        money mortgage.
    </li>
    <li>Option agreements:&nbsp;buyer&nbsp;acquires the right to purchase the property at a specified sometime some
        time in the future. Extension provisions can very important
    </li>
</ul>
<p>Sales contract with conditions, pre-conditions to close: A sales contract can be used to control the property
    until&nbsp;certain condition are met prior to closing. Sales contract usually have non-refundable good faith
    deposits, and there are usually extension provisions in the contract.</p>
<p>Lease with option to buy: land leases allow the lessee (prospective buyer) to control the property (subject to
    the lease provisions), and the lease has provisions allowing the lessor to purchase the property at certain
    times during the lease term. The price of the property should be specified, but often it is not so the purchase
    price is at the market value or at a price mutually agreed upon between the lessor and the lessee</p>
<ul>
    <li>Land contracts: The land contract provides for the title to pass from the seller to the buyer after certain
        specific terms and conditions are met.&nbsp;</li>
    <li>Interim land uses: These can provide rental income to the land banker which help to defray the holding
        costs. These uses can be as simple as seasonal hunting lease or as complex as a long term commercial lease
        with termination provisions.
    </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Establish minimum return requirements and expectations:&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;the land&nbsp;banker should
    clarify the return expectations for her investors and partners. For example the property will double in value
    in:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Five&nbsp;years if the annual appreciation rate is&nbsp;15%</li>
    <li>Ten&nbsp;years if the annual appreciation rate is 7%</li>
    <li>Fifteen&nbsp;years if the annual appreciation rate is 5%</li>
</ul>
<p>Clearly, the faster the general trends occur, the sooner that property can be sold to the land packager, and the
    higher the return is to the land banker.</p>
