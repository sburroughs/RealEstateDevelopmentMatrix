<h1>IV.1 Land Banking Environmental</h1><br>
<p>In land banking, <strong>the environmental tasks are primarily assessments and inspections</strong> to determine
    if future development proposals are viable and what potential uses may be. Some of this research may be done
    even before the acquisition task to decide if the land holding is able to create value and if the holding costs
    can be supported. </p>
<p><strong>The Environmental Task includes the 3 following subtasks.</strong></p>
<ol>
    <li>Phase I Study: Research and property inspection</li>
    <li>Surface conditions to consider: wetlands, rivers, abandoned mines, grave yards, geological formations</li>
    <ul>
        <li>If a property is known to flood or be on a fault line, it may not be a good investment for a land banker
            at all and therefore no acquisition.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <li>Historic and Cultural: research title and survey history</li>
    <ul>
        <li>Or if a property is a known civil war battlefield, this may prevent the purchase bythe land banker or if
            their goal is to preserve historical sites, than it meets the value expectation.
        </li>
    </ul>
</ol>
