<h1>III.1 Land Banking Market Analysis and Strategies</h1><br>
<p>Improvements – Property Redevelopment (VI.7.)</p>
<p>This is very similar to the Land Banking Stage; not much physical action, but lots of conceptual hard work.</p>
<p><strong>Plan and design new use for the site (with new and/or modified improvements).&nbsp;</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>“Adaptive re-use” is the new buzzword.</li>
    <li>A concept plan is helpful.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Need to sell the vision to many stakeholders, public and private.</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>Embrace the past history of the sight (one way or the other).</li>
    <li>Animated Videos are an invaluable aid; next best is a PowerPoint.</li>
    <li>Seek out stakeholders; this is the time to make new friends.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Create plan to perform and complete required physical improvements as needed:</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>Property security improvements</li>
    <li>Public safety improvements</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Interim Land Uses: First do no harm!</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>Improvements to accommodate interim land uses should not compromise the future re-development of the
        property.
    </li>
    <li>The neighborhood may not want to give up an amenity that you provided in good faith.</li>
    <ul>
        <li>Vegetable gardens</li>
        <li>Play fields</li>
        <li>Gathering areas</li>
    </ul>
</ul>
