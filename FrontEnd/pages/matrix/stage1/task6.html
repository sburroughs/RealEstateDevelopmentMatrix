<p>Improvements – Land Banking (VI.1.)</p>
<p>Land Bankers create the “concept plan.”</p>
<p>Land bankers often plan and design improvements to help land packagers appreciate what can be done with the
    property, such as:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Roads and lots dealing with physical features.</li>
    <li> Road systems that tie into existing transportation routes.</li>
    <li>Amenities and common areas for future development.</li>
    <li>Location of on-site water treatment facilities and/or storm water management facilities.</li>
    <li>Environmental features which must be embraced or avoided..</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Improvements for Interim land uses:</strong></p>
<p>First do not harm!</p>
<ul>
    <li>Maintain exiting road and drainage ditches.</li>
    <li>Maintain gates, fences and security systems.</li>
</ul>
