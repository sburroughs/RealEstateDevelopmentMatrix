<h1>II.1 Land Banking Financing </h1><br>
<p>Financing – Land Banking (II.1.)</p>
<p>Unreliable and inadequate annual income do not support debt payments.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Regular debt payments require regular rental income of regular equity contributions.</li>
    <li>With our predictable income form interim land uses, debt should be avoided.</li>
    <li>Very low loan-to-value ratio (0 is best).</li>
</ul>
<p>Equity partners must understand and accept the risks of land banking.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Land Banking is a waiting game and equity investor must be willing to wait for eventual returns from the
        sale of the property.
    </li>
    <li>Equity investors must be prepared to make additional equity contributions to meet annual cash shortfall
        because of required debt payments, insurance, or taxes.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>Cumulative preferred returns can sink the deal.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Land bankers requiring additional equity may be tempted to offer new equity investors a cumulative,
        preferred return.
    </li>
    <li>The cumulative , proffered return is a claim on the eventual proceed s from the sale of the
        property.&nbsp;</li>
    <li>However, because of the compound effect of this return scheme, the new equity investors’ claim may</li>
</ul>
<p> exceed the net proceed from sale.</p>
<p>Seller financing can be critical variable.</p>
<ul>
    <li>The&nbsp;buyer developer should look to the seller as a source funds to acquire the property.</li>
    <li>The selling&nbsp;developer should consider financing some of the sales price to the buying developer.</li>
    <li>There are costs and benefits in all of the various kinds of Seller-financing schemes:</li>
</ul>
<p>Seller financing; The seller lends the buyer the money to property. This also referred to as a purchase money
    mortgage.</p>
<p>Option agreements:&nbsp;buyer&nbsp;acquires the right to purchase the property at a specified sometime some time
    in the future. Extension provisions can very important.</p>
<p>Sales contract with conditions, pre-conditions to close: A sales contract can be used to control the property
    until&nbsp;certain condition are met prior to closing. Sales contract usually have non-refundable good faith
    deposits, and there are usually extension provisions in the contract.</p>
<p>Lease with option to buy: Land leases allow the lessee (prospective buyer) to control the property (subject to
    the lease provisions), and the lease has provisions allowing the lessor to purchase the property at certain
    times during the lease term. The price of the property should be specified, but often it is not so the purchase
    price is at the market value or at a price mutually agreed upon between the lessor and the lessee.</p>
<p>Land contracts: The land contract provides for the title to pass from the seller to the buyer after certain
    specific terms and conditions are met.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Interim land uses: These can provide rental income to the land banker which help to defray the holding costs.
    These uses can be as simple as seasonal hunting lease or as complex as a long term commercial lease with
    termination provisions.</p>
<p>Patient money is elusive but very important</p>
<ul>
    <li>Land Bankers look for capital that is “patient,” that is it does not require immediate returns and is
        willing to wait for the eventual sale of the property when the market conditions are favorable.
    </li>
    <li>Patient money is not “dumb money” and the expected returns must justify the risks involved.</li>
    <li>Patient money is hard to find.</li>
</ul>
