<h1>III.7 Property Redevelopment Market Studies and Marketing Strategies</h1><br><p>Market Studies &amp; Marketing
    Strategy – Property Redevelopment (III.7.)</p> <p>The Redevelopment Market Tasks are very similar to the Land
    Bankers Market Tasks.</p> <p>The land banker notes are at the bottom of these notes.</p> <p>Determine if the long&nbsp;term
    trends and&nbsp;future market conditions support the redevelopment of the property.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Are there long term trends that would&nbsp;improve the economic prospects of this site by changing the
        community’s perception of the property
    </li>
    <li>What are the alternative uses of the site? Adaptive Re-use potential.</li>
    <ul>
        <li>Residential condominiums</li>
        <li>Urban farming</li>
        <li>Special events staging</li>
        <li>Health care facilities</li>
        <li>Mixed use developments</li>
    </ul>
</ul> <p>Determine if the existing property be modified or de-commissioned to the prepare for the future market
    opportunities.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Is&nbsp;there something that can be done now that would improve the adaptive re-use of the site?</li>
    <ul>
        <li>Remove the railroad tracks</li>
        <li>Remove dilapidated buildings</li>
        <li>Remove special features like towers, kilns, vaults (unless they are historic)</li>
        <li>Contaminated materials above ground</li>
    </ul>
</ul> <p>Identify interim land uses that be accommodated on the property.</p>
<ul>
    <li>That is, are there tenants in the market that could be accommodated on the existing property without impairing
        the future redevelopment of the property?
    </li>
</ul> <p>Determine the future off-site infrastructure developments that could enhance the possibility of re-development
    or “adaptive re-use.”</p>
<ul>
    <li>Future rail spur for industrial properties</li>
    <li>Future&nbsp;transit station</li>
    <li>Water and sewer availability</li>
    <li>Future sports facility nearby</li>
</ul> <p>These are the Land Banking notes which may be helpful to the instructor:</p> <p>The discussion of future trends
    should begin with the Charles Kettering quote,” We should al be concerned about the future because we will spend the
    rest of our lives there.”&nbsp;(Charles Kettering, 1876-1958, inventor, engineer, and businessman)</p> <p>Land
    banker must identify general and specific long term trends and determine how they will effect the attractiveness
    (demand for) a specific property.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Identifying&nbsp;long-term trends is one thing, but interpreting those trends in terms of urban development and
        land use is much for difficult.
    </li>
    <li>Charles Kettering is also credited with the saying, “The harder I work the luckier I get.”</li>
</ul> <p><strong>The land banker must read widely and voraciously looking for new ideas and insights into future real
    estate development opportunities.</strong></p> <p>What kind of trends are we talking about?</p>
<ul>
    <li>Demographic change</li>
    <li>Online shopping, education, commerce</li>
    <li>Robotics</li>
    <li>Health care and prevention</li>
    <li>Globalization</li>
    <li>Terrorism</li>
    <li>Climate Change</li>
    <li>Regulatory Environment</li>
    <li>Infrastructure Improvements</li>
    <li>Other&nbsp;trends?</li>
    <ul>
        <li>Recycling</li>
        <li>Immigration</li>
        <li>Renewable Energy technologies</li>
        <li>Transportation technologies</li>
    </ul>
</ul> <p>Determine how will the general community and political establishment&nbsp;will&nbsp;react to those trends.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Maintaining&nbsp;the&nbsp;status quo is a very strong force in communities.</li>
    <li>Economic change will cause new financial winner and losers. Who are they?</li>
</ul> <p>When will the trends and the predicted effects occur?</p>
<ul>
    <li>Change&nbsp;will occur, but when?</li>
    <ul>
        <li>During the land bankers holding period</li>
        <li>Some land bankers have a very long holding period, some don’t.</li>
    </ul>
</ul> <p>Land Banker may focus on a particular event.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Completion of a transit way and/or a transit station</li>
    <li>Completion of the Panama Canal widening and deepening</li>
</ul>
