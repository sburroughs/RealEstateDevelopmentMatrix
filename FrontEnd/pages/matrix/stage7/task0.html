<h1>Property Redevelopment</h1>
<br>The “Property Re-developer” buys the property with such serious physical or functional deficiencies that the improvements must be torn down and/or re-developed for another use.  This essentially begins the real estate development process all over again. Essentially this is the same role as the "land banker" except that a land banker usually works with "green field" properties and the redeveloper usually works with "brown field" properties.   In every major city, government-sponsored redevelopment agencies are probably the largest players in the stage even though they didn’t exactly “buy” their holdings from building renovators.  Usually the municipalities acquire the properties through tax foreclosures and assign these properties to the redevelopment agencies to be sold.
