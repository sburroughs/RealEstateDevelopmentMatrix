<h1>I.7 Property Redevelopment Acquisition </h1><br>
<div><p>Acquisitions – Property Redevelopment (I.7.)</p>
    <p>The Acquisition tasks in the Property Redevelopment Stage are very similar to the Acquisitions Task in the Land
        Banking Stage except that the proposed redevelopment property has a history of land uses and improvements while
        the land banking property is undeveloped in the sense its current use is agriculture, timber, or recreational
        open space. The land banking property does not have a history of urban uses (old shopping malls) of intensive
        vertical development (old paper mill)</p>
    <p>Determine if the property can be acquired at an attractive price and terms that allows for holding the property
        until it is ready for repackaging.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Municipalities usually have a redevelopment agency or authority or a corporation that acts as the Property
            Redevelopment for the municipality. It’s job is to take contrail of the properties that the municipality has
            obtained though tax foreclosures and in that role it tries to find a land packager to acquire the property
            or at least take control of the property as it goes through the re-zoning process.&nbsp;Other property
            redevelopers may be corporation that have abandoned or unused facilities that they would like to sell as
            excess property.
        </li>
        <li>&nbsp;Property redevelopers may be opportunistic individuals that are convinced that a property will soon be
            ready to be re-zoned for a new economic life.
        </li>
        <li>&nbsp;The opportunistic redevelopers may have opportunities to negotiate acquisition terms that minimize the
            upfront cost as well as holding costs:
        </li>
        <ul>
            <li>&nbsp;Seller financing; The seller lends the buyer the money to property. This also referred to as a&nbsp;purchase
                money mortgage.
            </li>
            <li>&nbsp;Option agreements:&nbsp;buyer acquires the right to purchase the property at a specified sometime
                some time in the future. Extension provisions can very important.
            </li>
            <li>&nbsp;Sales contract with conditions, pre-conditions to close: A sales contract can be used to control
                the property until certain condition are met prior to closing. Sales contracts usually have
                non-refundable good faith deposits, and there are usually extension provisions in the contract.
            </li>
            <li>&nbsp;Lease with option to buy: land leases allow the lessee (prospective buyer) to control the property
                (subject to the lease provisions), and the lease has provisions allowing the lessor to purchase the
                property at certain times during the lease term. The price of the property should be specified, but
                often it is not so the purchase price is at the market value or at a price mutually agreed upon between
                the lessor and the lessee.
            </li>
            <li>&nbsp;Land contracts: The land contract provides for the title to pass from the seller to the buyer
                after certain specific terms and conditions are met.
            </li>
            <li>&nbsp;Interim land uses: These can provide rental income to the land banker which help to defray the
                holding costs. These uses can be as simple as seasonal hunting lease or as complex as a long term
                commercial lease with termination provisions.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </ul>
    <p>Determine what external events need to occur to improve the attractiveness of the property:&nbsp;</p>
    <ul>
        <li>&nbsp;Population growth</li>
        <li>Transportation improvements</li>
        <li>Technology changes</li>
        <li>Sustained regional&nbsp;economic growth</li>
        <li>Changed land use regulations</li>
        <li>Construction of transportation improvement</li>
        <li>Infrastructure capacity improvements</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Evaluate the political and governmental supportive of the redevelopment.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Determine the current support for redeveloping the property and/or the area.</li>
        <li>&nbsp;Develop a strategy in increase their support.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Determine if “de-commissioning” the property will increase its attractiveness.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Demolishing existing improvements may improve the market’s opinion of the properties potential.</li>
        <li>&nbsp;Removing obnoxious or toxic material may improve the property redevelopment potential.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Confirm that the public’s health and safety be assured during the redevelopment stage.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>The redevelopment property may be part of a blighted area or urban waste land.</li>
        <li>Can fencing, gates, or alarm systems be installed to prohibit people from entering the property?</li>
        <li>If the property is a public health of safety hazard, the property redeveloper should determine how to
            mitigate these risks and how much the mitigation plan will cost.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Find a “back door” if the redevelopment potential never materializes.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Before acquiring the property, the redeveloper must have a plan to sell the property.</li>
        <li>If things go well, the redeveloper will sell the property to a land packager.</li>
        <li>If things don’t go well, the redeveloper need to have a “back door” out of the deal.</li>
        <li>Cancellation of the purchase contract, or option contract.</li>
        <li>Default and foreclosure on purchase money mortgages.</li>
        <li>Donation to a charity or non-profit.</li>
        <li>Long-term “interim” land use.</li>
    </ul>
