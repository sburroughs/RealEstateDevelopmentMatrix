    – Building Operations (III.5.)</p> <p>Determine the right tenant mix.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Short term leases vs long term leases.</li>
    <ul>
        <li>Usually a balance&nbsp;of lease termination dates is important t manage the re-lease risk.</li>
        <li>A ten-year lease with 2 years left is a short term lease.</li>
    </ul>
    <li>Big space users vs smaller space users.</li>
    <ul>
        <li>This depends on the configuration&nbsp;of the property.</li>
        <li>What is the optimum size for a tenant?</li>
        <li>Are full-floor users the most efficient space.</li>
    </ul>
    <li>Office vs. retail vs. residential</li>
    <ul>
        <li>This is the mixed-use conundrum</li>
        <li>Each use has different requirements for access, security, and utility&nbsp;use.</li>
        <li>Ironically, automobile parking is usually the biggest factor in managing these uses.</li>
    </ul>
</ul> <p>Determine the existing tenants’ plans for expansion.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Existing tenants are the best prospects for leasing vacant space.</li>
    <li>Building operators&nbsp;need to understand their business plans and future space needs.</li>
</ul> <p>Identify tenants who are in the market searching for space.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Need to have a working knowledge of the current market activity&nbsp;(even if you are fully leased).</li>
    <li>Who is moving, how is looking; who is expanding?</li>
    <li>This part of the “leasing gossip circle” and important market information.</li>
</ul> <p>Determine who should approach potential new tenants?</p>
<ul>
    <li>Building operators always need to be marketing their space even if it is fully leased.</li>
    <li>If there is an active re-leasing effort,&nbsp;the Building operator needs to identify a strategy and a
        communication system to find and attract new tenants.
    </li>
    <li>All of the following are involved so it is important who gets paid for what and when:</li>
    <ul>
        <li>Tenant representatives</li>
        <li>Landlord representatives</li>
        <li>Direct (in-house leasing agents)</li>
        <li>Property managers</li>
    </ul>
</ul> <p>Evaluate the pricing of the existing available space.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Is&nbsp;the existing space appropriately in terms of competitive space?</li>
    <li>Are lease terms and concessions appropriate?</li>
</ul>
