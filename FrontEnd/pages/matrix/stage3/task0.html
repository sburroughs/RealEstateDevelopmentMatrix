<h1>Land Development</h1><br>The “Land Developer” buys the land with the
paper enhancements from the land packager and then improves the land so it can be sold as finished building pads to
building developer. This usually involves the construction of horizontal infrastructure such as roads and utilities
as well as common improvements such as water dentition ponds and recreational facilities. A good example of the land
developers are master-planned community developers who construct the roads, utilities, and recreational amenities
and then sell building lots to home builders.<img src="img/landdevelopment.png">
