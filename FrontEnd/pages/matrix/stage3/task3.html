<h1>III.3 Land Development Market Studies and Marketing Strategies</h1><br><p>Market Studies &amp; Marketing Strategy â€“
    Land Development (III.3.)</p> <p>Determine when the building developers will be ready to purchase the finished
    building site based on the following:</p> <p>When will the building users be ready to buy or lease the improved
    property?</p>
<ul>
    <li>Since the land developers are preparing lots to be sold to&nbsp;the building developers, the land developers
        must look beyond to the eventual building users to determine when the building developer is ready to buy.
    </li>
    <li>For example if the land development takes 2 years and the building development takes 2 years, the eventual users
        are 4 years away from occupying the space.
    </li>
    <li>What is the user demand four years from now?</li>
</ul> <p>Will the current market conditions continue or improve over the land development and sell-out period?</p>
<ul>
    <li>Once the land&nbsp;developer begins construction of the horizontal improvements, it is virtually impossible to
        stop construction without serious financial losses.
    </li>
    <li>The favorable market conditions must last long enough for the land developer to finish construction and sell the
        finished pads to the building developers.
    </li>
    <li>This is probably at 2-4 year window.</li>
</ul> <p>How will competitive properties respond to the new development?</p>
<ul>
    <li>Competitive properties can respond in may ways:</li>
    <ul>
        <li>Lower rents or increase inducemen</li>
        <li>Increase marketing efforts.</li>
        <li>Start new construction project.</li>
        <li>Delay planned construction.</li>
    </ul>
</ul> <p>Who are the active building developers in the market and how can they be approached?</p>
<ul>
    <li>Land&nbsp;developers sell their lots to a finite universe of possible building developers.</li>
    <li>Building developers are in competition with each other.</li>
    <li>Personal relationships from earlier projects are the best way to approach building developers with a new
        opportunity.
    </li>
    <li>Building developers must be assured that they will be treated fairly, no last look.</li>
</ul>
