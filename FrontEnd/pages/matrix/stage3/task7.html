<h1>VII.3 Land Development Transportation and Accessibility</h1><br><p>Transportation &amp; Accessibility – Land
    Development (VII.3.)</p> <p>Approved plans and specifications of on-site transportation systems with the appropriate
    federal, state, and regional and local authorities.</p> <p> •Interior roads and pathways to be given to public
    authority.</p> <p> •Interior roads and pathways to be kept private.</p> <p>Construct on-site circulation system to
    ensure efficient ingress and egress to each building pad.</p> <p> •Good traffic control systems are imperative.</p>
<p> •Minimize vehicular and pedestrian interaction (conflict).</p> <p>Integrate the construction of other horizontal
    improvements (water, sewer, power, communications) with the road construction activities.</p> <p> •Underground
    utilities should be installed first before road construction begins. </p> <p> •However, there are always changes and
    mistakes to deal with.</p> <p> •Thoroughly test and approve the underground work, prior to road construction.</p>
<p>Special cases: harbors, airports, rail terminals, hospitals, institutions.</p> <p> •These special cases involve
    transportation and accessibility issue that require special skills and planning.</p> <p> •They provide great
    opportunities for the land developer who understand the special needs and accommodations.</p> <p>Obtain the
    necessary approvals and permits for off-site improvements.</p> <p> •Off-site transportation improvements are
    extremely difficult to get approved by all of the various regulatory authorities.</p> <p> •Try to avoid constructing
    these off-site improvements.</p>
