<h1>Building Development</h1>
<br>The “Building Developer” buys the finished pad from the land developer and then does the vertical development by constructing the building improvements.  During construction, the building developer may also attempt to lease the building so the finished building can be sold to the building operator.  Home builders  are a good example of building developers.  On the commercial side, building developers are often called “merchant builders.”
