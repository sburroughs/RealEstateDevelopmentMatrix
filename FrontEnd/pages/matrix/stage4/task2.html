<h1>II.4 Building Development Financing </h1><br>
<p>Financing – Building Development (II.4.)</p>
<p>Like land development, this is a “beat the clock” game.</p>
<ul>
    <li>The building&nbsp;developer must be ready to start construction immediately so the that the improvements can
        be constructed and leased before the end of the construction loan.
    </li>
    <li>Some times building developers arrange a “mini-perm” with the construction lender which provides for an
        automatic extension of the construction loan if needed.
    </li>
    <li>Alternatively, the building developer can negotiate a “take-out” with another lender who will guarantee to
        pay off the construction lender (for a fee of course). The Building developer, the construction lender , and
        the take-out lender enter into a&nbsp;tri-party agreement&nbsp;to document this understanding.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>Building&nbsp;Pad acquisition can require equity and some debt.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Equity&nbsp;capital is usually used for the acquisition of the building pad. The building pad becomes part
        of the collateral for the construction mortgage.
    </li>
    <li>If debt capital is used to acquire the building pad, then this loan must be subordinated to the construction
        loan so that the construction loan will have a first lien position.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>Hard costs are usually financed with an accruing construction loan.</p>
<ul>
    <li>The interest on the construction loan&nbsp;usually accrues during the construction and lease-up period so
        the developer does not need to make out-of-pockets payment to the lender.
    </li>
    <li>However, this means that the developer must pay interest on interest. This is called compound interest and
        it accelerates the increase in the outstanding loan balance.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>Soft costs are usually financed with equity contributions.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Most soft costs are not funded with the construction loan.</li>
    <li>Therefore&nbsp;equity contribution must cover these important expenditures.</li>
</ul>
<p>Pre-leases create value.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Who ever leases the building&nbsp;lease reduces the risk of the investment therefore increase the value of
        the projected.
    </li>
    <li>A building that is 100% prelease to a credible tenant removes most of the market risk from the building
        developer.
    </li>
    <li>Similarly, building that have significant pre-leasing, say 30-70% are considered mush less risky that
        buildings that are started with out any leasing (‘all Spec”).
    </li>
    <li>Consequently, construction lenders will offer lower interest rates to preleased building development and
        reduce the level of person guarantees and credit enhancements.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>Building can be sold prior to completion, which would require hold backs.</p>
<ul>
    <li>These situations&nbsp;have pre-sales agreements that provide for a purchase price that is funded in stages.&nbsp; </li>
    <li>Initial funding occurs at a particular level of construction.</li>
    <li>Subsequent funding that are based on leasing activities.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <ul>
        <li>Tenant improvements holdback&nbsp;for unleased spaces are funded when the lease for the space are
            executed so the improvements can be built.
        </li>
        <li>Leasing commissions holdbacks for&nbsp;unleased space are funded when new leases are signed and the
            tenant occupies the space.
        </li>
        <li>Economic earn-outs are usually passed on the level&nbsp;of rental income increase as value is created
            during the lease-up period.
        </li>
    </ul>
</ul>
<p>Build-to-suit opportunities.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Space&nbsp;users who want to own and occupy their newly constructed building enter in to build-to-suit
        agreements with the building developer.
    </li>
    <li>These may be special purpose-buildings like medical laboratories or manufacturing plants.</li>
    <li>These be headquarter building with special, expensive finishes and meeting facilities.</li>
    <li>The building developer’s risk is much lower in these situation so the sales price can be much lower, all
        other things being equal.
    </li>
</ul>
