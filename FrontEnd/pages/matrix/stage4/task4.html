    construction systems must meet “best practices”for approvals and certifications.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Most important is documentation and organization of the process (materials receipts, recycling reports, etc.).
    </li>
    <li>Working with a reputable&nbsp;construction company familiar with sustainability will help to ensure that best
        practices are met and that any possible added costs of sustainability initiatives are minimized.
    </li>
    <li>In previous years, the extra cost of environmental certifications was estimated at 3-5%; however, due to the
        broad acceptance of the practices, there is usually no extra costs associated, only extra paperwork.
    </li>
</ul> <p>Local ordinances are rapidly changing to create new sustainability benchmarks.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Some municipalities&nbsp;have begun requiring third-party certifications for new development.</li>
    <li>Be aware of the current codes and of pending changes.</li>
    <p>For example, Washington DC imposed the Green Code, which has higher standard than LEED, does not allow for
        majority glass buildings, and added greater expectations for storm water management.</p></ul> <p>Vest your
    approvals as soon as possible to avoid designs that may be affected by changes in environmental regulations.</p>
<ul>
    <li>With the ordinances changing so frequently, it is important to vest your approvals under current ordinances as
        quickly as possible to keep construction on schedule, on budget, and on design.
