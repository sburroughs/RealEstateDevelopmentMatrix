<h1>Acquisition</h1>
<br>
<p>Each stage of development begins with the <strong>Acquisition Tasks</strong>.<strong
        style="font-family: inherit; font-style: inherit; line-height: 1.5em;">&nbsp;</strong><span>Often the Acquisition Tasks are broken down into five categories: feasibility studies, underwriting requirements, contract negotiations, and closing conditions.</span>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong style="font-family: inherit; font-style: inherit; line-height: 1.5;">Feasibility:&nbsp; Do the
        anticipated future benefits exceed the expected future costs?</strong></li>
    <ul>
        <li>Physical and engineering feasibility:</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Properties physical characteristics</li>
            <li>Cost to build whatever?</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Market feasibility:</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Current market conditions&nbsp;</li>
            <li>Future market conditions</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Financial feasibility:</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Simple Measures of Profitability</li>
            <li>Complex measures of Profitability</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Do the anticipated future benefits exceed the expected future costs?<strong>&nbsp;</strong></li>
    </ul>
    <li><strong style="font-family: inherit; font-style: inherit; line-height: 1.5;">Underwriting:&nbsp; Can capital be
        attracted to this development given the risk and returns of the development?</strong></li>
    <ul>
        <li>Required Rates of Returns</li>
        <li>&nbsp;How much capital?</li>
        <li>&nbsp;Who has this capital?</li>
        <li>How long is the capital needed?</li>
    </ul>
    <li><strong>Contract:&nbsp;&nbsp; How is title, control, monies, and associated risks transferred from the seller to
        the buyer?</strong></li>
    <ul>
        <li>The purchase contract defines how the title, control, monies, and associated risks are transferred from the
            seller to the buyer.
        </li>
        <ul>
            <li>What rights are being transferred?</li>
            <li>What representations and warranties are being made?</li>
            <li>To whom; from whom?</li>
            <li>Conditions to close? (Pre-closing conditions)</li>
            <li>Deadlines, milestones, deposits?</li>
            <li>Post-closing conditions?<strong>&nbsp;</strong></li>
        </ul>
    </ul>
    <li><strong>Due Diligence:&nbsp; Are the assumptions about development (legal, physical, economic, market) valid or
        have they been verified?</strong></li>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Confirm that the assumptions about future development (legal, physical, financial, market) are valid
            and have been verified? </strong></li>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Multi-disciplinary exercise </strong></li>
            <li><strong>No “limiting assumptions” –No excuses </strong></li>
        </ul>
        <li><strong>•Confirm that there is a reasonable possibility that this acquisition will meet or exceed the
            buyer’s development expectations and investment objectives. </strong></li>
        <li><strong>Ideally, the due diligence is performed before the good faith deposit become
            non-refundable&nbsp;</strong></li>
    </ul>
    <li><strong>Closing:&nbsp; Have all of the required conditions to close been met, and have all of the required
        documents been prepared, reviewed, and executed?</strong></li>
    <ul>
        <li>All of the required conditions to close must be met.</li>
        <li>&nbsp;All of the required documents have been prepared, reviewed, and executed.</li>
        <li>The capital is ready to be transferred.</li>
        <li>The post-closing obligations (development agreements) have been defined, documented, and guaranteed<strong>
            &nbsp;</strong></li>
    </ul>
</ul> <p>&nbsp;</p>
