<h1>Approvals and Permits</h1><br><p>In every stage that there are the required approvals and permits needed to operate
    , improve, or modify the property during the development. The developer must not only determine what approvals and
    permits are necessary, but he must also acquire these approval and permits in a timely and cost effective manner.
    The approvals may be at the federal, state or municipal level and they also may be from regional authorities or
    private individuals or organizations.</p> <p><strong>Developers must realize and accept the natural tension that
    occurs during this process.</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>Natural Tension Occurs:</li>
    <ul>
        <li>&nbsp;Between private and public ownership rights.</li>
        <li>&nbsp;Between federal, state, regional, and local governments.</li>
        <li>&nbsp;Between various departments and commissions within a government.</li>
        <li>Between adjacent land uses (neighbors).</li>
    </ul>
    <li>&nbsp;Every stage of the real estate development process requires some kind of governmental, quasi-governmental,
        or private approvals and/or permits.&nbsp;</li>
    <li>&nbsp;Remember: Real estate is a public good</li>
</ul> <p><strong>Developers must communicate with and understand the various individuals and agencies involved.</strong>
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Don’t fight, make friends.</li>
    <ul>
        <li>&nbsp;No one is going away.</li>
    </ul>
    <li>&nbsp;Find areas of agreement.</li>
    <ul>
        <li>&nbsp;Understand your needs and the needs of others.</li>
    </ul>
    <li>Structure workable compromises.</li>
    <ul>
        <li>Win-win solutions are imperative.</li>
    </ul>
    <li>Find timely resolutions.</li>
    <ul>
        <li>Time wounds all deals.</li>
        <li>Einstein once said, "The most powerful force in the world is compound interest."</li>
    </ul>
</ul> <p><strong>Developers must expect, and prepare for:</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>The worst:</strong></li>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>delays</strong></li>
        <li><strong>loss of confidentiality</strong></li>
        <li><strong>solicitation.</strong></li>
    </ul>
    <li>To have prior agreements or understanding retracted or rebuked..</li>
    <li>To have confidential information made public.</li>
    <li>To address social and community problems that the developer cannot solve.</li>
    <li>To appreciate a variety of points of view that may at first seem illogical or irrelevant.</li>
    <li>To appreciate the perceived realities of various stakeholders.</li>
    <li>To reject illegal, inappropriate, and questionable offers in the name of “finding a solution.”</li>
</ul> <p><strong>Developers must evaluate approvals and permits required at all public levels:</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>federal</strong></li>
    <li><strong>state</strong></li>
    <li><strong>regional</strong></li>
    <li><strong>municipal</strong></li>
    <li><strong>private</strong></li>
</ul>
