<h1>Financing</h1><br><p>The <strong>Financing Tasks</strong> require the developer to determine the amount and type of
    capital required to fund the initial acquisition, the interim holding costs, the completion of the required tasks,
    and eventual disposition of the development. The developer then must determine the most efficient method to raise
    the required capital and then to actually raise the capital. The financing tasks can be divided in to three
    categories: financial projections, financial management and projections, and capital formation and accumulation.</p>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Projections: What are the amounts and timing of expected capital expenditures, holding costs, and
        operating expenses as well as sales, rents, and&nbsp;other income?</strong></li>
    <ul>
        <li>Determine are the amounts and timing of expected capital expenditures, holding costs, and operating expenses
            as well as sales, rents, and other income.
        </li>
        <li>Stabilized pro-formas arenâ€™t enough.</li>
        <li>Negative cash flows are fatal! (Reserves, reserves, reserves)</li>
        <li>Accurate estimates of annual cash flows are needed for the real estate enterprise to create value.</li>
        <li>Financing structures must support and complement the real estate enterprise activities.&nbsp;</li>
    </ul>
    <li><strong>Financial management and reporting: How will the future capital flows be managed and to whom and in what
        form will they be reported?</strong></li>
    <ul>
        <li>Future capital flows must be managed, funded, distributed, and reported in a timely manner.</li>
        <li>General Rule: good real estate projects have good accounting; bad real estate projects have bad accounting
        </li>
        <li>Determine who will keep the books, disburse the funds, collect the rents, and prepare the reports.</li>
        <li>Who gets reports?</li>
        <ul>
            <li>IRS</li>
            <li>State Department of Taxation</li>
            <li>Equity Investors (sometimes Debt Investors too)</li>
            <li>Asset Managers</li>
            <li>Property Managers</li>
            <li>Others? (Certifications, professional groups, marketing)</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Establish annual budgets: report actual versus budget with variances&nbsp;</li>
    </ul>
    <li><strong>Capital formation and accumulation: Given the risk, returns, and timing of the capital flows of the
        development, what is the appropriate capital structure and sources and how can it be secured?</strong></li>
    <ul>
        <li>Financing must support the real estate enterprise!</li>
        <li>Interest rate: Fixed rate vs. variable rate</li>
        <li>Long-term, fixed rate fixed payment mortgage is only appropriate for building operations.</li>
        <li>Long term capital vs. short term capital</li>
        <li>Seller financing</li>
        <li>Equity investors</li>
    </ul>
