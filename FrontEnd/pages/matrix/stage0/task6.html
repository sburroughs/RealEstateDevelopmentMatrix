<h1>Physical Improvements</h1><br><p>The <strong>Improvement Tasks</strong> require the developer to determine what
    improvement (public or private; horizontal or vertical) need to be planned, designed, engineered, and construction.
    With that determination, the developer must be able to plan, design, engineer and or construct these improvements in
    a timely efficient and cost-effective manner.</p> <p></p> <p><strong>Planning and design:</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>Determine if the desired, permitted, or required improvements can be built on or in the space allocated for
        those improvements, i.e., can you put 10 pounds of sugar in a 5- pound bag?
    </li>
    <li>Determine if the desired improvements can be designed to meet market standards of acceptability.</li>
    <li>Determine if the talents of the requisite planners and architects are available to the developer.</li>
</ul> <p><strong>Engineering:&nbsp;</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>Can the planned or designed improvements be built in an attractive, timely, and cost-effective manner?</li>
    <li>Can the planned or designed improvement be engineered to meet the current and future standards for
        sustainability and safety?
    </li>
</ul> <p><strong>Construction:&nbsp;</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>Can the improvements be built on-time and on budget?&nbsp;</li>
    <li>Are the general and sub-contractors available to take on this project?</li>
    <li>Are the necessary materials available and affordable?</li>
</ul> <p><strong>Maintenance:</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>Determine how the constructed improvement will be maintained and operated in good working order over the life
        cycle of the improvements.
    </li>
    <li>&nbsp;Determine if the appropriate vendors are available to maintain and operate the improvements over their
        life .
    </li>
    <li>&nbsp;Establish appropriate reserves for future repairs and/or replacements.</li>
    <li>&nbsp;Warranties and Guarantees?&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
