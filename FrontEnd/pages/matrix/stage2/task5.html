<h1>V.2 Land Packaging Approvals and Permits</h1><br>
<p>Approvals and Permits â€“ Land Packaging (V.2.)</p>
<p><strong>Land packagers can create enormous property value increase by annexation agreements, zoning changes, and
    conceptual site plan approvals.</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>Each zoning designation has permitted uses.</li>
    <li>Easier to change the permitted use language than to change the zoning.</li>
    <li>Land use zoning is traditional.</li>
    <li>Urban envelope zoning is becoming popular.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>These approvals set the stage for future development, so they must be flexible yet clear.</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>Often design guidelines are part of the entitlement documents.</li>
    <li>Developer needs the flexibility to respond to changing market conditions.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Every approval that the land packager gets increases the value of the property to the land
    developer.</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>Unless the wrong land uses are approved.</li>
    <li>Unless there is no flexibility in the approvals.</li>
</ul>
