<p>Environmental â€“ Land Packaging (IV.2.)</p>
<p><strong>Determine what environmental conditions may impact zoning on master plan approvals. (Include physical
    environment, historic, and cultural conditions.)</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>Research&nbsp;any title constraints, current zoning restrictions, and review the preliminary environmental
        assessments to determine future prohibitions on revised zoning plans.
    </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Determine if the current zoning define or describe the environmental conditions of the site.</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>Review the current&nbsp;zoning for any environmental characterizations dictated by the municipality. Also,
        be sure to examine the definitions of those characterizations and if those definitions may be amended or if
        you can lobby that your site does not fit that definition. For example, flood plains may change if the water
        table changes over time.
    </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Determine what environmental/sustainability certifications are achievable for this project. </strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>Consider this early on to work with the environmental features of the site and to create synergies.</li>
    <li>Thinking ahead for sustainability certifications can affect&nbsp;decisions in the land packaging stage.</li>
    <ul>
        <li>Perhaps a grey water system may be implemented and integrated into the water and sewage system.</li>
        <li>If storm water detention is a concern, plan how that will be addressed and where water tanks and ponds
            will go.
        </li>
    </ul>
