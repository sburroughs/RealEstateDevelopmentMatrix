<h1>II.2 Land Packaging Financing </h1><br>
<p>Financing – Land Packaging (II.2.)</p>
<p>Land packager must “control” the land but doesn’t need to “own” it.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Seller financing; The seller lends the buyer the money to property. This also referred to as a purchase
        money mortgage.
    </li>
    <li>Option agreements:&nbsp;buyer&nbsp;acquires the right to purchase the property at a specified sometime some
        time in the future. Extension provisions can very important.
    </li>
    <li>Sales contract with conditions, pre-conditions to close: A sales contract can be used to control the
        property until&nbsp;certain condition are met prior to closing. Sales contract usually have non-refundable
        good faith deposits, and there are usually extension provisions in the contract.
    </li>
    <li>Lease with option to buy: land leases allow the lessee (prospective buyer) to control the property (subject
        to the lease provisions), and the lease has provisions allowing the lessor to purchase the property at
        certain times during the lease term. The price of the property should be specified, but often it is not so
        the purchase price is at the market value or at a price mutually agreed upon between the lessor and the
        lessee.
    </li>
    <li>Land contracts: The land contract provides for the title to pass from the seller to the buyer after certain
        specific terms and conditions are met.
    </li>
    <li>Interim land uses&nbsp;: These can provide rental income to the land banker which help to defray the holding
        costs. These uses can be as simple as seasonal hunting lease or as complex as a long term commercial lease
        with termination provisions.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;Like land banking, annual cash flows from interim uses are unreliable and inadequate.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Regular debt payments should be avoided.</li>
    <li>Equity capital calls should be expected.</li>
</ul>
<p>Equity partners need to make “capital calls” as needed.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Partner loans&nbsp;– equity partners are asked to loan money to the partnership instead of making equity
        contributions.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li>Dilution provisions&nbsp;– required in the partnership agreements if some partners make capital contribution
        and some partners don’t.
    </li>
    <li>Buy-sell agreements&nbsp;-- required in the partnership agreement to deal with the situation that occurs
        when some partners want to sell and some partners want to hold.
    </li>
    <li>Also this is a way to handle&nbsp;unresolvable partner disagreements.</li>
</ul>
<p>Public officials don’t understand compound interest!</p>
<ul>
    <li>The approval process is&nbsp;plagued by delays caused by public authorities putting off decisions or
        continuing discussing until the “next meeting.”
    </li>
    <li>This cause the land banker to incur additional holding costs as well as accrued interest on debt and
        cumulative preferred returns on equity.
    </li>
</ul>
