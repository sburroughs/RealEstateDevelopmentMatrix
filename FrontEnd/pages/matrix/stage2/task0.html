<h1>Land Packaging</h1><br>The “Land Packager” buys the raw land from the
passive land banker and then improves the value of the land through conceptual land planning, zoning changes,
financing schemes, or other “paper enhancements” like title insurance, accurate surveys, or environmental studies.
Examples of land packagers are land planning firms, politically skilled lawyers, and governmental agencies who
attempt to obtain government approvals of land they own. This “packaged land” is then sold to the “land
developer.”<img src="img/landpackaging.png" class="img-fluid">
