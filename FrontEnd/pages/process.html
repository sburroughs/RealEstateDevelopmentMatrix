    <h1>Development Process</h1>
    <p>
        We approach Real Estate Development Process holistically, from the time a land parcel is considered a "green
        field" (Land Banking) through the various
        stages until it becomes a "brown field" and is ready for Property Redevelopment. The Process is explained below
        using four (4) diagrams: a Venn diagram, a
        schematic diagram, a box diagram, and a circle diagram. Each diagram illustrates the same process; however
        providing slightly different perspectives and
        nuances on the relationships between the stages.
    </p>

    <h2>A Venn Diagram Description</h2>

    <div class="content-split">
        <p>
            This Venn Diagram in Exhibit 1.1 presents the seven-stage Real Estate Development Process and illustrates
            that
            the development stages are not neatly
            separated, rather they overlap to some extent. Effectively, a developer in one stage may capture some of the
            value in the next stage of
            development by incurring some costs and risks associated with the next stage. In doing so, the developer
            reduces
            the risks in the next stage and hopefully
            enhances value of the project to the next stage developer.
        </p>

    <h2>The Schematic Description</h2>

    <div class="content-split">
        <p>
            The schematic diagram in Exhibit 1.2 illustrates that decisions are made each stage of the Real Estate
            Development Process is relative to
            the creation of value. Each of the developers must make a conscious decision whether or not to sell to a
            third
            party or to continue to the next stage of
            development. In effect, the developer decides whether to cash in his chips and leave the table or to let the
            money ride and move onto the next stage of
            development.
        </p>

        <p>
            This diagram shows the order of the stages of development over the life of the real estate project as it
            moves
            from "green fields" in the Land Banking
            stage to the "brown fields" in the Project Redevelopment Stage. Both of these stages move to the Land
            Packaging
            Stage, where the project is redefined in
            terms of public approvals, market studies, and physical characteristics.
        </p>

        <p>
            Usually developers are good at one stage of development, but keep reaching back (up) or forward (down) in
            the
            process until their inadequacies catch up
            with them. The critical thing to note is that in each stage, certain tasks have to be completed to create
            value,
            and the accomplishment of these tasks
            require special skills and talents. No one is good at everything, no matter what their mother told them
            growing
            up.

    <h2>The Box Diagram Description</h2>

    <div class="content-split">
        <p>
            This Box Diagram in Exhibit 1.3 illustrates the seven-stage model and emphasizes that in each stage, the
            developer "buys one thing and sells another." The developer buys an "opportunity" and captures that
            opportunity
            by successfully accomplishing the requisite tasks in that stage. In doing so, the
            developer creates an "opportunity" for the developer in the next stage of development. If the developer is
            unsuccessful in creating value by accomplishing
            the required tasks, then the development stops until it can be restarted by another developer with the
            necessary
            vision and skills.
        </p>

    <h2>The Circle Diagram</h2>

    <div class="content-split">
        <p>
            The Circle Diagram in Exhibit 1.4 shows the relationship between each stage of development and demonstrates
            how
            the renovated
            building in the Renovation Stage may recycle back to the Building Operations Stage to be sold to a developer
            in
            the Redevelopment Stage. This diagram also
            illustrates how the Redevelopment Stage continues onto the Packaging Stage, and the cycle begins all over
            again.
