The land packager must be able to find properties that have a development issue or problems and fix that issue in a timely manner. This is why many land packagers have formal training in law , engineering, or land planning or have substantial experience in politics and government.</p> <ol> <li>Ready for development but improperly zoned.</li> </ol> <p>This is most common&nbsp;situation for the land packager. The land packager develops a conceptual land plan and set about getting that land plan approved by the appropriate governing bodies. These are usually zoning or planning commissions as well as city councils or county/township supervisory boards. The land packager must determine not only what approvals are needed , but also how to obtain those approvals in a timely manner.</p> <p> 2.Contains development impairments that can be remedied by studies, tests, and /or expert opinions.</p> <p>The land packager&nbsp;must correctly identify the development issues and then determine what experts can provide the information to clarify the problems or identify the best cost effective solutions to the problems. These problems may include wetland issues, contamination issues, soil and rock conditions, neighborhood concerns or protests, historical or cultural issues, or adjacent land issues such as railroads, airports, prisons, or coffee manufacturer.</p> <p> 3.Has existing title or survey issue.</p> <p>Most&nbsp;buyers avoid these kinds of problems, but with experience and special skills land packagers enjoy working out boundary issues, easement or right or way issues, existing liens, and clouds on the title. The timeliness and cost of fixing these issues is are the key factors for the land packager to assess. Almost any &ldquo;problem&rdquo; can be fixed with enough time and enough money., but the land packager cannot afford either.</p> <p>Evaluate if the regulatory environment&nbsp;is receptive to changing land use conditions.</p> <p>Clearly some&nbsp;municipalities and jurisdictions are easier to work in than others. However, know how the system or process works and who works the system is critical knowledge for the land packager. Perceived &ldquo;outsiders&rdquo; will bet treated much differently than known, credible, local people. The successful land packager will either need to be a &ldquo;good ol&rsquo; boy or gal&rdquo; or will be able to bring those people on her team.</p> <p>On the other hand, municipalities or jurisdictions that have a difficult reputation, are creating opportunities for land packagers because of the perceived &ldquo;barriers to entry&rdquo; that limit the number of competitive development. Land packager must critically evaluate their ability to work in the system and moor importantly to achieve permits and approvals in a timely manner.</p> <p><strong>Acquire or control the property with attractive prices and conditions.&nbsp;</strong> The important&nbsp;part is to control the property rather than to own the property outright. Creative financing often includes some of the following:</p> <p>Seller financing; The seller lends the buyer the money to property. This also referred to as a&nbsp;purchase money mortgage.</p> <p>Option agreements:&nbsp;buyer&nbsp;acquires the right to purchase the property at a specified sometime some time in the future. Extension provisions can very important</p> <p>Sales contract with conditions, pre-conditions to close: A sales contract can be used to control the property until&nbsp;certain condition are met prior to closing. Sales contract usually have non-refundable good faith deposits, and there are usually extension provisions in the contract.</p> <p>Lease with option to buy: land leases allow the lessee (prospective buyer) to control the property (subject to the lease provisions), and the lease has provisions allowing the lessor to purchase the property at certain times during the lease term. The price of the property should be specified, but often it is not so the purchase price is at the market value or at a price mutually agreed upon between the lessor and the lessee</p> <p><strong>Land contracts: </strong>The land contract provides for the title to pass from the seller to the buyer after certain specific terms and conditions are met.&nbsp;</p> <p>Interim land uses: These can provide rental income to the land banker which help to defray the holding costs. These uses can be as simple as seasonal hunting lease or as complex as a long term commercial lease with termination provisions.</p> <p>Are there&nbsp;interim land uses&nbsp;to be dealt with? (Positive or Negative?)</p> <p>Interim land uses are a two-edged sword.

Consequently,&nbsp;creative financing is not that important. However, the Building may negotiate certain terms in the purchase agreement that will prevent the Land Developer from impairing the competitiveness and profitability of the project. For example, the following provisions may be appropriate:</p> <ul> <li>Restrict the Land Developer&rsquo;s ability to sell lots&nbsp;to competitive projects for a certain period of time, say three years, or until the newly constructed building reaches a certain occupancy level.</li> <li>Provide a &ldquo;first right of offer&rdquo; to the Building Developer&nbsp;when additional lots are offered for sale.</li> <li>Estimate&nbsp;the Building Operators purchase price (based on overall capitalization rates) as well possible holdback that may be a condition of the sale. The Building Developer needs to pay off the construction loan at the time of sale so the hold backs cannot be too restrictive.</li> </ul> <p>Determine if the building can be competitively bid by contractors and sub-contractor.</p> <ul> <li>&nbsp;Building&nbsp;developers usually have preferred general contractor and major sub-contractors. The availability of these firms is a critical determinant of when or if the Building&nbsp;Developer decides to acquire the building pad.</li> <li>Current pricing of the construction project is imperative because the Building Developer may be using old or inaccurate building costs estimates.</li> </ul> <p>Determine if the property be pre-leased or leased up during construction.</p> <ul> <li>The best way for a Building Developer to create value is by pre-leasing&nbsp;the Building&nbsp;or leasing it up during construction.</li> <li>The Building&nbsp;Developer needs to understand the leasing market and develop a strategy to secure competitive leases</li> </ul> <p>Estimate if the current market conditions improve or remain steady during construction and lease-up</p> <ul> <li>If&nbsp;the current market conditions are good, how long will they last?</li> <li>If the current market conditions are bad, when will they change? We always recognize market bubbles after they occur, when it is too late to act.</li> <li>The Building&nbsp;Development period needs to include&nbsp;the pre-construction&nbsp;time, the building construction time, and the expected lease-up period.</li> </ul> <p>Determine the expected &ldquo;spread&rdquo; sufficient to justify the risk.</p> <ul> <li>Does&nbsp;the expected return justify the risks involved in the Building&nbsp;Development?</li> <li>The value created must be greater than the cost of the project so that the profit or spread is reward for the risk-taking.</li> </ul> <p>Estimate the capital requirements of the Building Development.</p> <ul> <li>The&nbsp;building&nbsp;developer need determine:&nbsp;</li> <ul> <li>how much capital is needed (uses of funds)</li> <li>who can provide the capital (sources of funds)</li> <li>how long the capital is needed (investment duration)</li> </ul> <li>Equity investors are needed to acquire the finished building lot and to fund cash flow deficits during the construction and lease-up period.
